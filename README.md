## Download and Setup PHP

1.  Step 1: download the files

    * For Mac and Linux users you can ownload PHP from official website http://php.net/downloads.php.

    * For windows users you can donwload PHP from here https://windows.php.net/download , don't forget to choose either 64Bit or 32Bit (82) based on your OS.

2.  Step 2: extract the files

    * After you download PHP as a zip file, then you need to extract PHP files and copy it where you OS is located Like **C:\php**.

3.  Step 4: add **C:php** to the path environment variable

    * **First way using Control Panel:** To ensure Windows can find PHP, you need to change the path environment variable. From the Control Panel, choose System, select the **‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù** tab, and click the **‚ÄúEnvironment Variables‚Äù** button. Scroll down the System variables list and click on **‚ÄúPath‚Äù** followed by the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button. Enter ‚Äú;C:\php‚Äù to the end of the Variable value line (remember the semi-colon). When you finish, you might need to reboot at this stage.

      `setx path "%path%;c:\php"`
